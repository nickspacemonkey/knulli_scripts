A collection of scripts I am using with Knulli.

Create the `services` folder if needed and add files to `/userdata/system/services`.

You can then toggle the scripts on/off in Knulli by pressing Start --> SYSTEM SETTINGS --> SERVICES

You will need to reboot before any of the settings take effect.
